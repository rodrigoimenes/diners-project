1 - `yarn` to install libs

2 - `docker-compose up` to create DB and run

3 - `yarn seed` to prepare DB (migrations, initial seed etc)

4 - `yarn start` to run on dev mode

5 - `yarn test` if you wanna run tests (always running coverage % :D - u can track that on coverage folder (after you run it))
